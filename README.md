# restaurant
A typical online restaurant management system where we can order items as per the preference(Veg or Non-veg).
There are two types of users: Customer and restaurant workers/admin.
1>>Customer should only see and order the item after registration and at the registration time, they have to choose the preference(Veg or Non-veg). After login, the customer should only see the item as per their specified preference during registration.
2>>Admin/Restaurant worker have access to the menu(they can add,delete and update item's attributes e.g., name of the dish, it's price, the rate etc.)
